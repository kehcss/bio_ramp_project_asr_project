# Bio Ramp Project

## Overview
The Bio Ramp Project is designed to fine-tune the Phi-4 multimodal instruct model on a speech task. This project leverages various Python libraries to facilitate the fine-tuning process, ensuring optimal performance and accuracy.

## Files
- **phi_4_finetuninig.ipynb**: Contains the code for fine-tuning the Phi-4 model, including necessary imports and the main logic for the training process.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists all the Python package dependencies required for the project.

## Setup Instructions
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd bio_ramp_project
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage Guidelines
To run the fine-tuning process, open the `phi_4_finetuninig.ipynb` file in a Jupyter Notebook environment and execute the cells in order. Ensure that all dependencies are installed and configured correctly before starting the training process.
